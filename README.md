# Dhwani - A Music Player

## Abstract

Dhwani is a music player, which incorporates most of the features of a modern music player app. Dhwani is currently pre-loaded with songs, and does not support uploading music from other sources. Even though it is pre-loaded with songs, it is as feature rich, and as powerful as other music players. It is a web app built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript along with a frontend framework called Vue.js.

Dhwani is a project done as a mini project for Data Structures & Algorithms [CT552], a course offered by the Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University. It helped us apply the concepts of DSA and realise the potential of DSA in a real world project.

Music players make use of several DSA concepts like queue, sorting algorithms and searching algorithms. Due to this fact, we decided on creating Dhwani for our DSA project.

The main objectives of building this project were as follows:

1. To apply theoretical knowledge of Data Structures & Algorithms in a real life project.
2. To create a project using web technologies.
3. To learn and implement Vue.js as a frontend framework.
4. To learn to collaborate and work in a group.
5. To get the hang of the best practises while coding a real life project and preparing ourselves for other major projects to come.
